# NOTE: Removing explicit urllib3 pin because it conflicts with
# other requirements. Let the package resolver choose a compatible
# version of urllib3 for the pinned `kubernetes` package.
# If you need a specific urllib3 range, pin a kubernetes version
# that is compatible with it instead.
# Allow newer kubernetes releases so pip can select a version
# compatible with the environment's urllib3 requirement.
# Pin a maximum if you want to avoid breaking changes, e.g. <36.0.0
kubernetes>=34.1.0,<36.0.0
boto3==1.42.25
botocore==1.42.26
requests==2.32.5
prometheus-client==0.24.0
python-dotenv==1.2.1

# Security: pin urllib3 to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2025-66418
# CVE-2025-66418 fixed in urllib3 2.6.0. Use >=2.6.0 to ensure the fix is present.
# If you hit dependency conflicts (notably with older kubernetes or requests
# releases), update those packages to compatible versions instead of downgrading urllib3.
urllib3>=2.6.0,<3
